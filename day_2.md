# Chapter 2
- attribute is property of an object
- data is collection of data objects and their attributes
- diff types of attributes: nominal (ID numbers; =, !=), ordinal (on a scale: for rankings i.e comparison; <, >), intervals (+, -), ratio (comparitive; *, /) 
- properties of attributes (distinctness, ranking/order, diff is meaningful, ratios are meaningful)
- From nominal to ratio (the properties followed increase one by one)
- Categorical Qualitative (Nominal, Ordinal) / Numeric Quantitative (Interval, Ratio)
- Characteristics (Dimensionality i.e. num of attributes, Sparsity i.e asymmetry so focussing on presence, resolution)
- Data form (Table - record data, matrices, document data - frequency matrix, Transaction data - Market Basket data, Graph data [Records have relationshiop with each other],)
- Ordered Data (Order of transactions - Can help make stocking decisions), Genomic Sequence data)
- Spatio-temporal data
- Data Quality: Noise & Outliers (two diff things, noise means wrong values)
- Outliers can mess up analysis by a lot
- Missing values (eliminate data objects, ignore missing values during analysis, estimate the missing values)
- Duplicate data
